# UniTime – AI-Powered Academic Scheduling Platform

UniTime is a web-based academic learning and scheduling platform developed using **Spring Boot** and **React** with a **MySQL** database. It allows academic administrators to manage professors, courses, rooms, and schedules effectively while providing a modern and intelligent scheduling solution.

## 🚀 Project Overview

UniTime is designed to streamline academic scheduling by combining traditional admin tools with smart features powered by AI. It enables the university admin to manage professor assignments, schedule lectures/labs, and allocate rooms efficiently. Students can view courses, enroll in them, and vote for preferred professors to guide AI-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Novelty Feature – Smart Scheduling with Professor Voting

Implemented as a microservice using Python (scikit-learn) integrated with the core Spring Boot backend. This novelty introduces intelligent automation to academic scheduling.

### 🔍 Features:
- **Student Voting System**: Students vote for their preferred professors per course.
- **AI-Powered Professor Selection**: Balances student preferences and current workloads to recommend the most suitable professor.
- **AI-Driven Room Allocation**: Automatically assigns rooms based on capacity, type (Lab/Lecture Hall), and required facilities (e.g., projector, computer).
- **Conflict-Free Scheduling**: Checks for professor, student, and room availability before suggesting time slots.
- **Automated Notifications**: Sends schedule updates via email to students and professors upon finalization.
